Chaos engineering is the practice of injecting failures into systems to test resilience.

LLMs are probabilistic models that generate text based on learned patterns.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation improves factual accuracy by grounding answers in documents.

Fallback routing improves system availability during partial failures.

Service Level Objectives define reliability targets for systems.

Prometheus is used for monitoring distributed systems.

Grafana is used to visualize metrics.

Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures.

Observability includes metrics, logs, and traces.
