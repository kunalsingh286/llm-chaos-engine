# 🚀 LLM Chaos Engineering & Reliability Platform

> A production-grade, self-healing platform for building **reliable, trustworthy, and governable LLM systems**.

This project demonstrates how modern AI systems can be engineered to **fail safely, recover automatically, and continuously validate quality** — inspired by Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices.

---

## 🌟 Why This Project?

Most LLM projects focus only on:
- Prompting
- APIs
- UI

This platform focuses on what actually matters in production:

✅ Reliability  
✅ Resilience  
✅ Trustworthiness  
✅ Governance  
✅ Release Safety  

> **I don’t just build AI systems. I engineer them for failure.**
